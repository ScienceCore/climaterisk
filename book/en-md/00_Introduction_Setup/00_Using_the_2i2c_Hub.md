### What to Expect:

<!-- #region jupyter={"source_hidden": true} -->
By default,  logging into [`https://climaterisk.opensci.2i2c.cloud`](https://climaterisk.opensci.2i2c.cloud) automatically clones a repository to work in. If the login is successful, you will see the following screen and are ready to start working.

**Notes:** Any files you work on will persist between sessions as long as you use the same username when logging in.
